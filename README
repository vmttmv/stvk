stvk - simple terminal (vulkan fork)
--------------------
A vulkan fork of https://git.suckless.org/st/

DISCLAIMER
----------
This project is in development and highly subject to change.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files,
vulkan drivers + headers, and glslang.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

TODO
----

- Fallback font mechanism.
- Swapchain/render target resize mechanism needs to be revised and built robust.
- Resizeable glyph atlas and SSBO.
- Zoom
- Possibly use the explicit vk cleanup func (requires changes to st's exits...)
- Most likely plenty bugfixes.
